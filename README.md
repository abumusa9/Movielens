GroupLens Research provides a number of collections of movie ratings collected from users of MovieLens in the Late 1990s and early 2000s.
The MovieLens 1M dataset contains 1million ratings collected from 6,000 users on 4,000 movies. 
It's spread across three tables: ratings, user information, and movie information. From this dataset I am going to analyse the following: 
(1) Top Movies among Males and Females. 
(2) Measuring Rating Disagreement.
(3) Most popular Genres.
(4) User vs Movies distribution.
(5) Movies recommendar engine.
